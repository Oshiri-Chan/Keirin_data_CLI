# Keirin Data Update Tool Startup Flow

## Startup Flow Overview

1. When main.py is executed, first setup_application_logger() in logger.py is called to set up the logging environment
2. KeirinUpdaterCore is initialized, and directory existence check and creation is performed
3. app_core.startup() is called, and the application startup process is executed
4. GUI module is imported, and the tkinter root window is created
5. An instance of KeirinUpdaterGUI class is created, and GUI initialization is performed
   - LogManager initialization
   - Variable initialization
   - Manager initialization
   - Config file loading
   - UI construction
6. root.mainloop() is called, and the GUI event loop starts
7. When the application ends, app_core.shutdown() is called and termination processing is executed

- Main processing (main.py, logger.py, core/application.py, gui/keirin_updater_gui.py)
- Core processing (core/application.py, database/keirin_database.py, config.py)
- GUI related (log_manager.py, ui_builder.py, update_manager.py, db_initializer.py)
- Update processing (api/winticket_api.py, api/yenjoy_api.py, services/update_service.py)
- Dependencies and data flow between components

## Main Component Roles

1. main.py - Application entry point
2. KeirinUpdaterCore - Application core, providing basic functionality
3. KeirinUpdaterGUI - User interface and event handling
4. LogManager - Log management and display
5. UIBuilder - User interface construction
6. KeirinDatabase - Database operations
7. UpdateManager - Data update process management
8. WinticketAPI/YenjoyAPI - External API integration
